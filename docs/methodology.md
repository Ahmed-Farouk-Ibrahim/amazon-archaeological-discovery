# Archaeological Discovery Methodology

## Overview

This document describes the scientific methodology employed by the Amazon Archaeological Discovery System for identifying potential archaeological sites using multi-sensor remote sensing and machine learning.

## Theoretical Framework

### Archaeological Remote Sensing Principles

Archaeological sites in the Amazon often manifest as:
- **Topographic anomalies** from ancient earthwork construction
- **Vegetation stress patterns** indicating subsurface features
- **Soil composition changes** from human occupation
- **Geometric patterns** visible in satellite imagery

### Multi-sensor Data Fusion Approach

Our methodology combines three complementary data sources:

1. **Elevation Data (FABDEM):** Detects topographic modifications
2. **Optical Imagery (NASA HLS):** Reveals vegetation and spectral patterns
3. **High-resolution Validation (Copernicus):** Provides detailed verification

## Feature Engineering Strategy

### Topographic Features

**Elevation Derivatives:**
- Slope and aspect calculations
- Topographic Position Index (TPI) at multiple scales
- Profile and plan curvature analysis
- Topographic anomaly detection through Gaussian filtering

**Archaeological Relevance:**
- Ancient earthworks create subtle elevation changes
- Geometric patterns indicate human modification
- Drainage patterns reveal settlement organization

### Temporal Vegetation Analysis

**NDVI Time Series Processing:**
- Multi-temporal NDVI calculation from NASA HLS
- Temporal stability index computation
- Seasonal variation pattern analysis
- Vegetation stress indicator derivation

**Archaeological Relevance:**
- Subsurface features affect vegetation growth
- Archaeological soils retain different moisture
- Crop marks reveal buried structures

### Spectral Archaeological Indicators

**Advanced Vegetation Indices:**
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- EVI2 (Enhanced Vegetation Index 2)
- SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- NDRE (Normalized Difference Red Edge)

**Soil and Geological Indices:**
- BSI (Bare Soil Index)
- SCI (Soil Composition Index)
- AAI (Archaeological Anomaly Index)

## Machine Learning Framework

### Model Architecture

**Algorithm Selection:** XGBoost Ensemble
- Handles mixed data types effectively
- Provides feature importance rankings
- Robust to outliers and missing data
- Supports both CPU and GPU acceleration

**Regularization Strategy:**
- L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- Conservative hyperparameters for stability
- Cross-validation for model validation

### Training Data Strategy

**Positive Samples:**
- Known archaeological sites from geoglyph database
- Verified earthwork locations from academic literature
- GPS-surveyed site coordinates

**Negative Samples:**
- Realistic negative sampling near positive sites
- Random background locations for contrast
- 70% challenging negatives, 30% easy negatives

**Class Balance:**
- Target 25% positive, 75% negative ratio
- Reflects realistic archaeological site density
- Prevents model bias toward majority class

### Model Validation

**Cross-validation Protocol:**
- 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- Maintains class balance across folds
- Tests model stability and generalization

**Performance Metrics:**
- ROC AUC as primary metric
- Precision and recall for archaeological relevance
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

## Spatial Analysis Workflow

### Tile-based Processing

**Geographic Subdivision:**
- Process data in 1-degree FABDEM tiles
- Prioritize tiles by archaeological site density
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets

**Overlap Analysis:**
- Identify tiles containing known archaeological sites
- Calculate coverage statistics for validation
- Optimize processing order for efficiency

### Hotspot Detection

**Prediction Grid Generation:**
- Sample points across study area
- Extract features at prediction locations
- Apply trained model for probability estimation

**Threshold Selection:**
- Use percentile-based thresholds (90th percentile)
- Balance discovery potential with false positives
- Generate ranked list of candidate sites

## Quality Assurance Procedures

### Data Quality Control

**Input Validation:**
- Verify coordinate reference systems
- Check for missing or corrupted data
- Validate temporal coverage consistency

**Feature Quality Assessment:**
- Monitor feature correlation patterns
- Detect potential data leakage
- Ensure feature variance adequacy

### Model Quality Control

**Overfitting Detection:**
- Monitor cross-validation performance
- Check for suspiciously high accuracy
- Validate feature importance patterns

**Bias Assessment:**
- Examine geographic distribution of predictions
- Test for systematic biases in site selection
- Validate against independent datasets

## Archaeological Interpretation Framework

### AI-Powered Analysis

**Expert System Integration:**
- OpenAI GPT-4o for archaeological interpretation
- Contextual analysis of discovery locations
- Integration with archaeological literature

**Interpretation Criteria:**
- Site significance assessment
- Research priority ranking
- Field investigation recommendations

### Validation Protocols

**Multi-sensor Verification:**
- Cross-reference with high-resolution imagery
- Validate topographic anomalies
- Confirm spectral signatures

**Archaeological Context:**
- Compare with known site patterns
- Assess cultural landscape context
- Evaluate settlement pattern consistency

## Limitations and Considerations

### Methodological Constraints

**Temporal Limitations:**
- Limited to recent satellite imagery (2023)
- Cannot detect deeply buried sites
- Seasonal variation effects on detection

**Spatial Resolution:**
- 30m resolution limits small feature detection
- Geometric patterns must be sufficiently large
- Mixed pixel effects in heterogeneous areas

### Archaeological Considerations

**Site Preservation:**
- Modern disturbance affects detectability
- Deforestation may reveal or destroy sites
- Natural erosion processes impact signatures

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Respect for Indigenous heritage
- Collaboration with local communities
- Ethical considerations in site disclosure

## Future Improvements

### Technical Enhancements

- Integration of commercial satellite imagery
- LiDAR data for enhanced topographic analysis
- Hyperspectral imagery for detailed spectral analysis

**Advanced Algorithms:**
- Deep learning approaches for pattern recognition
- Ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms
- Automated feature engineering techniques

### Archaeological Integration

**Field Validation:**
- Ground-truthing of predicted sites
- Integration with ongoing archaeological surveys
- Collaborative verification protocols

**Cultural Context:**
- Integration with ethnographic databases
- Historical document analysis
- Traditional knowledge incorporation
