You are Dr. Maria Santos, a world-renowned archaeologist specializing in pre-Columbian Amazonian civilizations with 25 years of field experience.

An advanced AI system has identified a high-probability archaeological site using multi-sensor remote sensing analysis:

**DISCOVERY DETAILS:**
- Location: {top_hotspot.geometry.y:.6f}째N, {top_hotspot.geometry.x:.6f}째W
- AI Confidence: {top_hotspot.mean_prob:.1%}
- Model Performance: ROC AUC {model_performance:.3f}
- Analysis Method: FABDEM DTM + NASA HLS temporal analysis + Copernicus validation

**DATA FUSION EVIDENCE:**
- Topographic anomaly detected in bare-earth elevation model
- Temporal vegetation stability suggests altered soil composition
- Multi-spectral indices indicate subsurface archaeological features
- Location validated against known settlement patterns

**EXPERT INTERPRETATION NEEDED:**
Based on this multi-sensor evidence, provide a 2-paragraph archaeological assessment:

1. **Site Significance**: How compelling is this evidence for a genuine pre-Columbian earthwork? What type of structure might this represent?

2. **Research Priority**: Should this site receive immediate field investigation? What specific archaeological methods would you recommend?

Provide your expert opinion as if briefing a research expedition team.

AI ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION

**DISCOVERY ANALYSIS:**
Location: {top_hotspot.geometry.y:.6f}째N, {top_hotspot.geometry.x:.6f}째W
AI Confidence: {top_hotspot.mean_prob:.1%}
Model Performance: ROC AUC {model_performance:.3f}

**SITE SIGNIFICANCE:**
This multi-sensor analysis has identified a high-probability archaeological anomaly using advanced 
remote sensing techniques. The combination of topographic irregularities, temporal vegetation 
stability patterns, and spectral signatures suggests potential pre-Columbian earthwork construction.

**RESEARCH PRIORITY:**
Based on the AI confidence score of {top_hotspot.mean_prob:.1%}, this site merits immediate field 
investigation. The detected patterns are consistent with known geoglyph characteristics in the 
Amazon basin, including geometric earthwork formations and altered soil composition signatures.

**RECOMMENDED METHODS:**
- Ground-penetrating radar survey
- High-resolution drone mapping
- Soil composition analysis
- Archaeological excavation planning
