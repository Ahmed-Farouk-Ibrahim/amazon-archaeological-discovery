# Discovering Lost Civilizations: AI-Powered Archaeological Site Detection in the Amazon Basin

## Abstract 

We present a comprehensive AI-powered archaeological discovery system that successfully identified a high-confidence potential archaeological site in the central Amazon basin using multi-sensor remote sensing and machine learning. Our methodology integrates NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 imagery, Copernicus Sentinel-2 data, and FABDEM elevation models with OpenAI GPT-4o for expert archaeological interpretation.

The system employs advanced feature engineering to extract topographic anomalies, temporal vegetation stability patterns, and spectral signatures characteristic of ancient earthworks. A regularized XGBoost ensemble model, trained on 1,698 known geoglyph sites from the James Q. Jacobs Archaeological Database, achieved 0.91 ROC AUC with stable cross-validation performance (0.8614 ± 0.0691), demonstrating scientifically credible accuracy for archaeological prediction.

Our discovery at coordinates -8.77565°N, -64.11925°W represents a previously unidentified potential archaeological site with 75% AI confidence. OpenAI GPT-4o analysis suggests significant likelihood of anthropogenic features consistent with pre-Columbian earthwork construction, warranting immediate field investigation. The methodology successfully balances archaeological impact with investigative rigor, providing reproducible evidence validated through independent multi-sensor analysis. This work demonstrates how AI can accelerate archaeological discovery while respecting Indigenous heritage and supporting collaborative research with local archaeologists in threatened Amazon regions.

## Introduction: Unveiling the Amazon's Hidden Past
The Amazon rainforest, spanning over 6 million square kilometers, conceals countless archaeological treasures beneath its dense canopy. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing and artificial intelligence have opened unprecedented opportunities to discover and document these sites before they are lost to deforestation and development. Our research addresses this urgent need by developing a comprehensive AI-powered system capable of identifying potential archaeological sites across the vast Amazon basin.
